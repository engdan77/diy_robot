# DIY Wilma Robot

### Background

After building some construction on the garden my 4 year old daughter and I built a small robot of some spare wood planks :hammer: 
I've tried to explain to her that daddy builds robots at his work ... perhaps not entirely accurate though :grin:
So quite naturally thinking we'll need to give this robot a brain :bulb: .. this might be a fun [DIY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself) (Do It Yourself) project
that might be fun and share for inspiration :smirk:

While my daughter have her boxes with toys so did luckily her dad .. so was just a matter start using the soldering iron ..
I'll explain below what items were needed and how to glue these together, 
if you feel uncomfortable soldering you may instead purchase a [breadboard](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1893684840.html) instead.
The cost for such project shouldn't have to cost more than a tiny 10 Euros

And finally I'll have written some MicroPython :snake: for those who doesn't know is a [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)
implementation optimized to run on microcontrollers.
