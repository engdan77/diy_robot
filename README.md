# DIY Wilma Robot

### Background

After building some construction on the garden my 4 year old daughter and I built a small robot of some spare wood planks :hammer: 
I've tried to explain to her that daddy builds robots at his work ... perhaps not entirely accurate though :grin:
So quite naturally thinking we'll need to give this robot a brain :bulb: .. this might be a fun [DIY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself) (Do It Yourself) project
that might be fun and share for inspiration :smirk:

While my daughter have her boxes with toys so did luckily her dad .. so was just a matter start using the soldering iron ..
I'll explain below what items were needed and how to glue these together, 
if you feel uncomfortable soldering you may instead purchase a [breadboard](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1893684840.html) instead.
The cost for such project shouldn't have to cost more than a tiny 10 euros.

And finally I'll have written some MicroPython :snake: for those who doesn't know is a [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)
implementation optimized to run on microcontrollers.

### How to wire the components


### How to configure and upload the software

- Follow [these](https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp32/tutorial/intro.html) instructions to upload MicroPython to your ESP32

- Update the following lines in main.py
```python
# Configure your wifi

WIFI_SSID = 'xxxx'
WIFI_PASS = 'xxxx'
```

- Upload the following files to the ESP32 flash using e.g. ampy described better [here](https://boneskull.com/micropython-on-esp32-part-1/).
    - jq6500.py
    - main.py


### Upload voice prompts

Connect the jq6500 module to available USB and it will open a "downloader" (on Windows) and you can then
upload all prompts found in the **voice_prompts** folder. More details and hints could be found [here](https://sparks.gogo.co.nz/jq6500/index.html).

### The final result
